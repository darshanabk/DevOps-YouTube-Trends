## Constraints
1. **Budget**: Limited to free tools and services.
2. **Time**: Milestones must be completed within the defined timeline.
3. **Data Limitations**: Restricted by YouTube API quotas and available data fields.
4. **No Database**: Data is directly pulled from GitHub (JSON files) and visualized through Streamlit.

---

## Assumptions
1. YouTube Data API provides accurate and up-to-date data.
2. The project is primarily for analytics purposes, not for public release.
3. No external funding or paid services will be used.

---

## Risks
1. **Quota Exhaustion**: Exceeding YouTube API limits during testing.
   - *Mitigation*: Use efficient queries and monitor API usage.
2. **Data Quality Issues**: Null values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust data cleaning processes.
3. **Streamlit Performance**: Large datasets may impact visualization performance.
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize data handling and use pagination where necessary.
