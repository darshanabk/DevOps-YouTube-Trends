In this video, Liz and Seth discuss the differences and similarities between DevOps and SRE, ultimately realizing that DevOps and SRE aren't two competing methods, but rather close friends designed help break down organizational barriers to deliver better software faster. DevOps is like an abstract class in programming, and SRE is one possible implementation of that class.\n\nSite Reliability Engineering: https:\/\/goo.gl\/aCiiPV\nHow SRE relates to DevOps: https:\/\/goo.gl\/NWKuj9\nManaging Deployments with Kubernetes Engine Qwiklab: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2zdFQh5\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

It has become a buzzword within days of its release and professionals in all fields, especially in high skilled areas like lawyers, doctors, engineers are questioning whether such AI can actually replace them and work.\n\nSo in this video I want to talk about what ChatGPT is and how it even popped up, talk a bit about the organization behind GPT called \"OpenAI\", which has already created many other machine learning models besides Chat GPT and also explain technically about all that.\nAnd then we'll dive in and actually put ChatGPT to use for some DevOps related tasks.\nI really want to see how it can help in generating configuration code for building DevOps processes or different parts of those processes and how well it knows different DevOps technologies, but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate code that I can get from official documentation, but instead also try more fine-tuning and small optimizations in that configuration code.\n\nWe're also going to check out an open source command line tool that is built on top of ChatGPT and was specifically created for engineers to generate infrastructure as code templates and more and finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT, the quality and usefulness of such a tool for engineers and whether it will really replace the engineers and to what extent you should be concerned.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n01:39 - What is ChatGPT, Who developed ChatGPT\n06:45 - Sign Up on ChatGPT\n09:23 - Create Dockerfile for Node.js app using ChatGPT\n22:13 - Create Kubernetes manifest file using ChatGPT\n35:06 - Create CI\/CD pipeline code using ChatGPT\n50:06 - Convert Jenkinsfile into GitLab CI config file\n53:53 - Tools built on top of OpenAI's API\n55:01 - AIaC demo - CLI tool for DevOps\n01:01:00 - My opinion on ChatGPT & whether ChatGPT will replace engineers\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/32UVSZP\nDEV                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3h2fqiO\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

This video discusses building blocks of the DevOps and SRE practice of measurement: Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs):\n\n\"Service Level Objectives\" in the O'Reilly SRE Book: https:\/\/goo.gl\/3btxFE\n\n\u2192 SLIs are Service Level Indicators or metrics over time which inform about the health of a service.\n\u2192 SLOs are Service Level Objectives which are agreed upon bounds for how often those SLIs must be met.\n\u2192 SLAs are business-level agreements which define the service availability for a customer and the penalties for breaking that availability.\n\nSLIs and SLOs are the prescriptive way in which SRE practices the DevOps principle of \"measure everything\". Implementing SLOs also forces collaboration between product owners and systems operators, adhering to the DevOps principle of \"break down organizational barriers\". This is why we say class SRE implements DevOps.\n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/CKv3tV\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content: https:\/\/goo.gl\/S0AS51",

        "videoDescription":"Differences and Overlaps of Cloud and DevOps Engineer Roles as well as deep dive of Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n\nDevOps engineer and Cloud engineer are 2 popular roles in software engineering. But there is a lot of mix up of these two roles and many people and many companies often use them interchangeably. They mix the tasks and responsibilities of these two very often. For example there are plenty of job descriptions for \"DevOps Cloud Engineer\" or \"Cloud DevOps Engineer\", which would naturally make you think that they are the same role, but then why would you have two names for the same role? And that's exactly what I'm going to discuss and clarify in this video.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca1  What is DevOps and DevOps Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n                                                                                                     \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/0yWAtQ6wYNM\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udca1  From Zero to DevOps Engineer - Roadmap              \u25ba   https:\/\/youtu.be\/G_nVMUtaqCk\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a DevOps Engineer in 6 months                 \u25ba   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BPxlGf\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a Kubernetes Administrator                        \u25ba   https:\/\/youtu.be\/pDrjQWo3CxI\n\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\ude80  Become a DevSecOps Expert and 10x your value  \u25ba   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45gUXQU\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Thank you JetBrains for sponsoring this video \ud83d\udc4f  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nHow to Use the Space Git Flow With TeamCity \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/space_git_flow \nGet started with Space for free \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/jetbrains_space\nTry TeamCity for CI\/CD \u2013 https:\/\/jb.gg\/jetbrains_teamcity\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and why people mix up these two roles?\n01:47 - DevOps Engineer role\n02:46 - Different Objectives of DevOps and Cloud Engineer\n04:02 - The need for Cloud Engineers\n08:42 - Cloud Engineer Task: Configure with Best Practices\n10:35 - Cloud Platform specific knowledge\n13:36 - More Cloud Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities\n15:58 - Infrastructure as Code\n17:10 - Differences between DevOps and Cloud Engineer\n17:39 - Overlaps between Cloud and DevOps Engineer \n20:25 - Wrap Up\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nFull Python course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  \u25ba  https:\/\/youtu.be\/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2W9UEq6\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b   \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                           \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3hWOLVT\nINSTAGRAM                      \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                            \u25ba  https:\/\/bit.ly\/3i54PUB\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Courses & Ebooks & Bootcamp \ud83d\ude80      \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u25ba Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/45mXaer\n\u25ba High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3BNS8Kv\n\u25ba Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc   https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Ozl28x",

There is a lot of discussion going on, where some people are asking whether platform engineering replaces DevOps. Many people say it goes hand in hand and is rather an addition to DevOps, but in reality it's a bit more complicated than that. Platform engineering actually changes a lot of established rules we knew about DevOps, SRE and Cloud engineering, it changes the game and introduces some new rules.\n\nSo let's clearly define, what platform engineering exactly is, more interestingly, why was there even a need for this new role and how it evolved and of course how it compares to DevOps and Cloud engineering and does it really replace any of these roles?\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n0:00 - Intro and Overview\n0:50 - Why Platform Engineering?

        "videoDescription":"In this video, learn how to create a test plan in Azure DevOps to use with the Regression suite automation tool (RSAT). RSAT helps you automate acceptance testing of your Finance and Operations apps and significantly reduces the time and cost of user acceptance testing (UAT).  \n\nUAT is typically required before you take a Microsoft application update, or before you apply custom code and configurations to your production environment. RSAT also lets functional power users record business tasks by using Task recorder and then convert the recordings into a suite of automated tests, without having to write source code.  \n\nLearn more: https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/dynamics365\/fin-ops-core\/dev-itpro\/perf-test\/rsat\/rsat-overview \n\nThank you for watching our video!

We'll use metrics to find slow or erroring queries, traces to find interactions between components, and logs to understand the errors in more detail.\n\nTo get started with this functionality, Google Cloud offers Stackdriver Service Monitoring.\n\nReference Links:\nStackdriver Service Monitoring \u2192  http:\/\/bit.ly\/2p5M0Yx \nDrill down into Stackdriver \u2192 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2wJdVS7\nImproving Reliability with Error Budgets, Metrics, and Tracing in Stackdriver \u2192 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2x8QoKI \n\nReach out to Liz and Seth:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/sethvargo\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/lizthegrey\n\nWatch more episodes from the playlist here \u2192 http:\/\/bit.ly\/2PPL6f0\nSubscribe to the Google Cloud Platform channel for more Cloud content \u2192 http:\/\/bit.ly\/GCloudPlatform",

We also discuss the importance of checking for bugs and ensuring stable features before deployment, and the role of CI\/CD and devops in the build process.\n\n#FrontendDevelopment #BuildProcess #DevOpsInAction #tanaypratap \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike, Share, and Subscribe for more!\n\nFollow me on my other social media handles for all updates, events, and live sessions-\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tanaypratap\/\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tanayofficial\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tanaypratap\/\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/tanaypratap\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. \n\nHow is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story. I am telling it in parts every day.",

        "videoDescription":"Transformational Leadership and DevOps: Beyond the Research\n\nDr. Steve Mayner, SPCT and Senior Consultant, Scaled Agile, Inc. \n\nWhy do some Agile and DevOps transformations succeed while others fail? This is the fundamental question that led to groundbreaking research by Dr. Steve Mayner on transformational leadership and organizational change brought about by Agile and DevOps adoption. Transformational leaders communicate a clear inspirational vision, lead with integrity and authenticity, show genuine care and personal recognition for individuals, and empower their teams to look beyond the status quo to drive innovative solutions. Research shows that when leaders exhibit these behaviors it results in higher success rates for organizational change efforts and high performing teams.\n\nAt DOES 2016 in San Francisco, Dr. Mayner presented the findings of his research confirming the correlation between transformational leadership and successful organizational change in Agile and DevOps initiatives. Partnering with Gene Kim and IT Revolutions, he also shared the results of a research experiment illustrating that presenters at DOES conferences demonstrate strong transformational leadership behaviors. At DOES 2017 in London, Gene and the teams from DORA and Puppet announced that they had found in the 2017 State of DevOps Survey that high performing teams consistently had leaders who exhibited these same transformational behaviors, and these behaviors also strongly correlated with high employee Net Promoter Scores (NPS). \n\nOne of the most exciting findings from the research is that anyone can learn to become a transformational leader! In this DOES 2017 presentation, Dr. Mayner continues the conversation by sharing his experience developing a program to help leaders at all levels grow their transformational leadership competency. He will highlight the key components of the program as well as the implementation strategy that began with the C-suite of the company leading the way. Participants will receive practical tips for starting similar efforts in their own organizations, and will hear about opportunities to participate in future research and program development for transformational leadership training.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps:\/\/events.itrevolution.com\/us\/",

As DevOps initiatives mature, brittle toolchains built from point solutions break down, increasing cost, reducing visibility, and creating friction instead of value. Unlike DIY toolchains, a true DevOps platform let's teams iterate faster and innovate together.

The core values of devops is effectively based on the Agile Manifesto but with one slight change which moves the focus from creating a working software to one that is more interested in the end-to-end software service mechanism and delivery.\n\nWhy NoOps is important\n\nThe concept of NoOps is that the software environment could be automated to a certain level where there\u2019s no need for an operations team to manage it. NoOps, for \u201cno operations,\u201d is a concept that drives a trend that has been marching ahead.\n\n------------------------------\nFor more information:\nPlease write us to sales@intellipaat.com or call us at: +91-7847955955\n\nWebsite: https:\/\/intellipaat.com\/devops-architect-masters-training-program\/\n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/intellipaatonline\n\nTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/s\/Learn_with_Intellipaat\n\nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/intellipaat\n\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/intellipaat\/\n\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Intellipaat",

This video brings to life my presentation from the DevOps Meetup in Munich on November 15, 2023, offering a deep dive into the evolution of software development methodologies and the pivotal role of DevOps in driving innovation.\n\nEmbark on a journey from the constrained waterfall methodologies to the agile landscape, where a product-centric approach addresses real customer needs. Discover the challenges that plague the industry, from legacy systems and budget constraints to the \"wall of confusion\" that disrupts effective collaboration. More than a strategy to overcome these hurdles, DevOps emerges as a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.\n\nExperience the power of DevOps through the success stories of industry giants like Tesla and SpaceX, illustrating how Agile and DevOps principles can elevate a company's market position. Gain insights into the essential capabilities for enhancing software delivery performance, inspired by the seminal book \"Accelerate.\"\n\nLearn about the critical role of Platform Engineering and the Digital Factory model in embedding DevOps practices within product teams. This innovative approach not only simplifies the development process but also ensures consistency and fosters an environment ripe for continuous value delivery and breakthrough innovation.\n\nJoin me in this exploration of DevOps' potential to revolutionize the embedded industry, paving the way for future advancements.

        "videoDescription":"This video captures my presentation delivered at the DevOps Meetup in Z\u00fcrich on January 25, 2024, where I delve into the prevalent challenges faced by traditional DevOps methodologies, characterized by isolated teams and fragmented value streams that impede efficiency. It explores DevOps as a holistic culture, mindset, and suite of technical practices designed to foster continuous value delivery, prioritize products over projects, and focus on customer-centric development. Additionally, I introduce Platform Engineering as a strategic evolution of DevOps aimed at mitigating the technical and operational complexities encountered when scaling DevOps in larger enterprises. Highlighting a collaborative project with LGT and Z\u00fchlke, I present the Platform Plane case study, demonstrating how an internal developer platform can streamline and standardize DevOps processes across various teams, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity. This presentation goes beyond theoretical discussion, offering a hands-on demonstration of the Platform Plane and its functionalities, including Kubernetes as a service, API gateway, and Service Mesh, among others. It illustrates the vital role of Platform Engineering in enabling product teams to adopt DevOps more efficiently and effectively, leading to an optimized development lifecycle.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Intro\n00:08 Welcome\n00:31 About me\n02:36 Today's challenges\n04:33 DevOps is here to help\n05:20 Who is DevOps?\n06:44 The Benefit of DevOps\n08:05 DevOps is bullshit?\n08:27 What are the Challenges with DevOps?\n08:59 You build it you run it\n10:18 Think about that on scale.\n11:06 Can you scale DevOps?\n11:23 Example of What companies want\n15:50 The Digital Factory \n16:35 Platform Engineering Enables DevOps in Product Teams.\n18:30 The Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2024. \n19:29 Platform Engineering Improves DevOps Efficiency.\n20:24 The Platform Plane: Big Picture.\n22:04 The Platform Plane: High Level Architecture\n21:56 Demo 1 - The Admin Areas\n25:56 Demo 2 - Platform Plane\n26:01 Platform Plane- Main page\n26:27 Documentations\n27:38 AI Assistant\n29:21 Platform plane:\n30:12 - GitLab\n30:44 - Repositories \n32:13 - Registry\n33:40 - Package Management\n36:42 - Hypervisor ( virtual machines)\n36:52 - Identity \n37:56- Chat\n39:07 Summary\n39:45 Outro\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  L I N K S  \ud83d\udd17\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nPlatform Plane: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/rSUI6-R4DlM\n\nLGT: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.lgt.com\/\n\nZ\u00fchlke: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.zuehlke.com\/\n\nDevOps Meetup Z\u00fcrich: \n\u27a4 https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/devops-meetup-zurich\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Want to learn more? \ud83d\ude80  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nYou're developing products, not projects \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/ImbhUFr6suw?si=UeSOAR67hZcJWE5T\n\nDevOps \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ath3XoLbYxY?si=xzJzs4Fqpst6uxqm\n\nApply continous testing and build-in quality \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/W0QZRpf7ElM?si=oe54rFG0uEXtHUbJ\n\nApply continous security \n\u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/340YmM08Eb0?si=QFOGkCnUElDXevR-\n\nBuild a platform\n \u27a4 https:\/\/youtu.be\/UE8mSt55xHw?si=cc6_S_6Wv6iwA_y1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  S U B S C R I B E  \ud83d\udd14 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2566\u2550\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u255a\u2563\u255a\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2554\u2563\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2550\u2563\n\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u255d\u2551\u2551\u2560\u2557\u2551\u255a\u2563\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2551\u2550\u2563\n\u255a\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2569\u2550\u2569\u2550\u255d\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCXvlc9x4zlv5DEqbby55Ivg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac Connect with me \ud83d\udc4b  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nLINKEDIN                  \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/romanoroth\/\nTWITTER                   \u25ba https:\/\/twitter.com\/RomanoRoth\nINSTAGRAM             \u25ba https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/romanoroth\/\nFACEBOOK               \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/romanoroth\/\nMEETUP                   \u25ba https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/de-DE\/DevOps-Meetup-Zurich\/\nCONFERNCE            \u25bahttps:\/\/www.devopsdays.ch\/\nHOMEPAGE              \u25ba  https:\/\/www.romanoroth.com\/\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac  P L A Y L I S T S  \u25b6\ufe0f \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \nModern Software Engineering\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_rb56rZQr2fyBGR3cyanZpX\nDevOps\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_ro3fn1G-3Ui2mBPHxOD9kF\nGitLab: Build a DevSecOps Pipeline\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLrsbMazVPK_qhf3ahA_zRPlwBaGGhSu2P\n\n#devsecops  #devops #romanoroth #platformengineering",

No \ud83d\ude09.\nDon't panic and check out the talk \ud83c\udf9e I had with Pia Wiedermayer on this topic.\n\nIs DevOps really the reason why testing and quality assurance (QA) employees are being increasingly automated out of a job?\nPia Wiedermayer, Head of QA, and Romano Roth, Head of DevOps, discuss different ways to incorporate the wealth of experience of testing and QA specialists into the agile team culture.\n\nInsight: \n- DevOps is often equated with automation\n- What does this mean for people in these roles and with these responsibilities?\n- Testers offer a wealth of experience that can be incorporated into the\nagile team culture\n\nSoftware testing and quality assurance are changing. Topics such as agility, DevOps and automation strongly influence existing roles and areas of responsibility in software quality assurance as well as during the entire software life cycle. Standard testing and QA roles no longer exist in many (project) organisations. Dedicated testing teams are increasingly a thing of the past.\n\nWhat does this mean for people in these roles and with these responsibilities? Is there no room for them anymore? Are their skills and expertise no longer needed?\n\nDevOps is often equated with automation. Is DevOps responsible for automating employees out of a job? What is behind the hype and who or what is DevOps actually?\n\nPia Wiedermayer, Head of Quality Assurance https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/piawiedermayer\/, and Romano Roth, Head of DevOps, at Z\u00fchlke Switzerland tackle these questions. They talk about the challenges in their projects, examine roles and tasks and reveal new paths for professional and personal development. They also discuss ways to incorporate the wealth of experience of testers into the agile team culture and whether automation is the new testing.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac T I M E S T A M P S \u23f0  \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n00:00 Introduction\n00:19 How is your project?\n01:18 How was it in the past? \n01:53 How is it today? \n02:53 Does DevOps help?\n03:23 What do you think about that? \n03:49 What is DevOps?\n04:33 Who is DevOps? \n05:00 Your role in the past\n05:26 Your role in the future\n06:06 How to automate? \n08:00 1.

More than a strategy to overcome these hurdles, DevOps emerges as a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.\n\nExperience the power of DevOps through the success stories of industry giants like Tesla and SpaceX, illustrating how Agile and DevOps principles can elevate a company's market position. Gain insights into the essential capabilities for enhancing software delivery performance, inspired by the seminal book \"Accelerate.\"\n\nLearn about the critical role of Platform Engineering and the Digital Factory model in embedding DevOps practices within product teams. This innovative approach not only simplifies the development process but also ensures consistency and fosters an environment ripe for continuous value delivery and breakthrough innovation.\n\nJoin me in this exploration of DevOps' potential to revolutionize the embedded industry, paving the way for future advancements.

Request only private parallel jobs unless you have a valid reason for public jobs.\n\nApproval Timeframe: It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for Microsoft to approve parallel job requests.\n\nVerification: After approval, you can verify the availability of parallel jobs in the Azure DevOps portal under the \"Parallel Jobs\" section in the billing settings.\n\nBilling Setup for Additional Jobs: For additional parallel jobs, users need an active Azure subscription (e.g., Pay-As-You-Go), and setup billing, linking it to the Azure subscription. This will allow for purchasing more parallel jobs if needed.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb This complete tutorial is compiled by Sandeep Soni, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, a Software & Corporate Trainer for 27years!  \nFor more Training Courses Visit: https:\/\/www.bestitcourses.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud83d\udc4b \nCall Sandeep Soni for Career Guidance \u25ba +91 98490 01840 \nConnect with me on LINKEDIN \u25ba https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sandeepsoni123\/ \n \n\ud83d\udc4d \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb'\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \n- Like the video if you found it helpful. \n- Subscribe to our channel for more DevOps tutorials and certification guides. \n- Hit the bell icon to get notified of our latest videos. \n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Conversation \nHave questions or need further clarification?

It\u2019s huge right now in the tech community, and it\u2019s definitely becoming more central to how teams build software.\nIf you\u2019re starting with DevOps, this video will help you understand the basics and give you a good head-start on your journey. You will also learn about the different stages in DevOps, what tools are needed at each stage, and how potential problems should be handled.\n\nStart your DevOps Career (Beginners - Advanced) - https:\/\/bit.ly\/DevOpsLearningPath-YT\n\nIn this video we will cover the following topics:\n\n00:00 -  Introduction\n00:27 - Problems before DevOps\n01:33 - Two Stages of DevOps\n02:12 - Real World Scenario 1\n03:28 - Real World Scenario 2\n04:12 - Automation\n05:06 - Benefits of DevOps\n06:10 - Summary\n07:22 - Conclusion\n \nThose new to the Programming and DevOps world often find it challenging to start their journey due to the missing basic prerequisites. For example, issues with setting up a basic lab environment using VirtualBox, problems with networking, or trouble with working with the Linux CLI or text editors like vi editor. Sometimes there are issues with applications - like getting a sample application to work, problems with getting the dependencies to install correctly or trouble with getting a web server to communicate with a database server. Or, at other times, it's working with data formats like JSON or YAML.\n\nSo we have identified a gap, and we believe that this is due to missing some of the basic prerequisites, such as knowing the basics of Linux, the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, it is crucial to have these basics cleared. And that\u2019s why we are helping you to bridge that gap!\n\nWant to view a clear path to becoming a DevOps Engineer?

You have a new Django application and you're ready to deploy it; what next?  You have an existing Django application and you set up the servers yourself; what can you do better?\n\nI\u2019m the co-founder CTO of [Zagaran, Inc.](https:\/\/zagaran.com), a software consulting company.  Over the past 10 years, we\u2019ve built, maintained, and deployed dozens of Django websites, and have an extensive playbook for how to do that well.  In this talk, we'll draw from that playbook and go through the main issues for a creating a robust and secure Django deployment.  For each issue, we'll look at the technologies and techniques to solve it.  We'll focus on AWS as a hosting platform, but the techniques at play will work on any major cloud provider.  This talk will cover the following:\n* Application hosting\n* Resilience to server failures\n* Automating deployment\n* Secrets management\n* File storage\n* Error monitoring\n* Server maintenance\n* (and more!)\n\nThis talk was presented at: https:\/\/2023.djangocon.us\/talks\/hosting-and-devops-for-django\/\n\nLINKS:\nFollow Benjamin \"Zags\" Zagorsky \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\nFollow DjangCon US \ud83d\udc47\nhttps:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@djangocon\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/djangocon\n\nFollow DEFNA \ud83d\udc47\nhttps:\/\/www.defna.org\/\n\nVideo production by Confreaks \nFollow Confreaks \ud83d\udc47\nhttps:\/\/confreaks.com\nhttps:\/\/x.com\/confreaks",

And so platform engineers build and design internal developer platforms, and help and serve users. \u201c\n\nThis conversation, hosted by Heather Joslyn, TNS features editor, dove into platform engineering: what it is, how it works, the problems it is intended to solve, and how to get started in building a platform engineering operation in your organization. It also debunks some key fallacies around the concept.\n\nThis episode was sponsored by Humanitec.\n\nKaspar Von Gr\u00fcnberg - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kvgruenberg\/\nHeather Joslyn - @ha_joslyn  \nThe New Stack - @thenewstack",

        "videoDescription":"Microservices have significantly increased operations complexity and security footprints. Even a small infrastructure with 50 virtual machines comprises tens of microservices consuming dozens of cloud provider platform-as-a-service services. Developer productivity can be hindered by DevSecOps teams who block developer self-service to avoid security risks. Developers raising support tickets to DevSecOps may wait days for responses. Organizations that allow developers unfettered access risk the security of their cloud infrastructure. Today, organizations face the challenge of creating self-service automation that can abstract DevOps and security nuance, so that developers can focus on their applications. In other words: DevOps as a service.

For every new Novo Nordisk partner, the IT team had to provide new environments and access. Novo Nordisk built a delivery platform to deploy its research collaboration platform in a multi-cloud setup on top of GitHub with integration from Azure DevOps. The fast, compliant delivery of the solution is a major benefit of teaming with Microsoft. The time to bring on new independent research teams has decreased from three to six months to only several hours. Novo Nordisk can now unlock synergies in a partnership or a consortium in methods development, biological analysis, and shared data science learning. \n\nRead full story here https:\/\/customers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/story\/1703023298904319840-novo-nordisk-azure-devops-github-pharmaceuticals-denmark \n\n #microsoft #microsoftazure",

        "videoDescription":"Microservices have significantly increased operations complexity and security footprints. Even a small infrastructure with 50 virtual machines comprises tens of microservices consuming dozens of cloud provider platform-as-a-service services. Developer productivity can be hindered by DevSecOps teams who block developer self-service to avoid security risks. Developers raising support tickets to DevSecOps may wait days for responses. Organizations that allow developers unfettered access risk the security of their cloud infrastructure. Today, organizations face the challenge of creating self-service automation that can abstract DevOps and security nuance, so that developers can focus on their applications. In other words: DevOps as a service.

The goal is to improve collaboration, and not have two silos with the dev team sitting on one side and the ops team sitting on the other.\n\nSo I have always seen devops as a mindset and just another fancy way of saying software engineer.\nFor me the goal has always been to build cross-functional teams to reduce dependencies in organisations.\nThis concept has been popularised by the AWS mantra \"You build it you run it\" where you have the need for teams with T shaped or even better V shaped engineers.\n\nThe DevOps approach works well but when you start having several teams each implementing different ways of going to production you are solving the same problem multiple times.\nAlso these solutions need to be maintained and it's a full time job.\n\nPlatform engineering focuses on building and maintaining the infrastructure and the systems that supports applications and services. \nTheir goal is to support developers in the organisation by creating and maintaining the platform. Developers are the consumers and customers of the platform (Product).\n\nIDP stands for internal developer platform. And it's the way developer interface with the toolchain in their organisation.\nThe goal is to have teams using a self-service portal to support their application throughout the SDLC\n\n#devops #platformengineering\n\nWHO AM I:\nHey friends, welcome to my YouTube channel  @outofdevops  .

It's distributed so people around the world can share code\n2. It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

Il nous explique que Testrail est l'outil de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour r\u00e9diger les cas de test et suivre les campagnes de test, tandis que Java S\u00e9l\u00e9nium est utilis\u00e9 pour les tests automatis\u00e9s des applications web. Azure DevOps est l'outil utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9crire les User Story et suivre les sprints de projets. Selon Arnaud Walet, la cl\u00e9 du m\u00e9tier de QA est de se mettre \u00e0 la place de l'utilisateur final et de s'imaginer tous les cas de figure qui pourraient mettre en d\u00e9faut l'application. Le QA doit donc s'assurer que l'application r\u00e9pond correctement et ne pas se contenter de prouver que tout fonctionne. Pour Arnaud Walet, la plus-value du QA r\u00e9side dans sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver les rouages qui pourraient mettre en d\u00e9faut l'application et \u00e0 les remonter afin qu'ils soient corrig\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nVous voulez travailler dans l'IT ?

        "videoDescription":"In this series we will learn the concepts of DevOps from a perspective of developers. How can these concepts help us be better developers and managers in our day to day jobs. In a startup you might need to fill the shoes of a DevOps, in a big company you might need to communicate with a DevOps team that has wildly different ideas.\n\nWe will gain a different perspective and understanding of the entire process by leaving our comfort zone and focusing on the wider picture. We will learn about different disciplines such as platform engineering and so much more.\n\nIn the first installment we discuss version control. As developers, we see it as a tool to collaborate and save our code. To track our mistakes and changes. In this video we learn why it's a crucial nexus point with the DevOps team and how we can work better to enable that.\n\n\u2705  You can see the article that goes with this post here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/devops-for-developers-introduction-and-version-control\n\n\u2705  Check out the full series in the blog here: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/series\/devops4dev\n\n\u2705  Check out the playlist for this series here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2HatFLh4xoA&list=PL8GhfcywW9YOA5i7kEFdNYFuluotS2JTZ\n\n\u2705  Check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ for other great content.\n\nTitle: DevOps 4 Devs-Introduction: Basic DevOps Tools & Version Control | git\n\n===============================\n\n\u2705  Subscribe To Channel For More Great Content on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n\u2705  Stay Connected With Me.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/debugagent \n\ud83d\udc49 LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shai-almog-81a42\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 Website: https:\/\/debugagent.com\/ \n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/shai-almog \n\ud83d\udc49 Mastodon: https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@debugagent \n\n=============================\n\n\u2705  Recommended Playlists: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Course - Module 1: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k&list=PL8GhfcywW9YM3OsfxnaxAci6dJgkuOQWn \n\n\u2705  Other Videos You Might Be Interested In Watching: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 3: Watch and Evaluate   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DGjVVKCNosM \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 2: Program Control Flow   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GSeg5L31XXw \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Practical Debugging at Scale Part 1: Introduction   \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A919j_5qE0k \n\n=============================\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to our channel for more videos on debugging and programming: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@debugagent \n\n=================================\n\nDisclaimer: We do not accept any liability for any loss or damage which is incurred from you acting or not acting as a result of listening to any of our publications.

To learn more check out https:\/\/debugagent.com\/\n\nThis channel contains videos that comprise the first module covering debugging. Here we focus on IntelliJ\/IDEA and  Java\/JVM but the basic logic and tooling should be applicable to many other IDEs and platforms. We discuss debugging features that are niche and often unknown e.g.:\n\n* Marker Objects\n* Entry Renderers\n* Instance tracking\n* Memory object inspection\n* Tracepoints\/Logpoints\n\nand much more!\n\nBy leveraging these tools and techniques you will gain access to the secret weapon of senior developers and consultants. This will make you a better developer and a happier one. \n\nIn the following modules we cover:\n* Debugging Theory\n* Tooling\n* Writing Debuggable Code\n* Kubernetes (k8s)\n* Serverless\n* Fullstack\n* Observability \n\nThe full course includes more than 5 hours of video material.",

It does version control\n\nSo, with version control, you can take snapshots of the state of your current code and maintain a history.\n\nBranching is really the third thing. Git branches allow developers to do isolated development and take chances without messing up the main branch.\n\nSo when someone asks me 'What is Git?', that is how I typically respond.",

        "videoDescription":"CHECK OUT MY DEVOPS COURSE WITH 85% OFF COUPON AT https:\/\/sre.rs\n\nHello everyone,\n\n\nI've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications,\naimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host\ntheir infrastructure.\n\nThis video shows the first part of setting up WireGuard VPN.\n\nTL;DR:\nCourse page: https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish\/?referralCode=9AC467077593D22878A2\nDiscount coupon is available at https:\/\/sre.rs\n\nDetails:\nTo get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar -\nI'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals,\nyou probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team,\nit usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills\nburied a lot of startups before they got anywhere.\n\nAs for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers.\nIf you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS,\nor if you don't have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you.\nThat being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail\nfor a complete beginner.\n\nI encourage you to watch \"free preview\" videos to get the sense of what\nwill be covered, but here's the gist:\n\nThe goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server\nwhich will have \"everything\" a startup or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git,\nCI\/CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc.\nIt can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9%\nand other than that being a good feeling, I'm not worried that some AI bug will lock my account\nwith no one to talk to about resolving the issue.\n\nConsidering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn't go in depth in any of those.\nThink of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you\nall the junctions where I think it's useful to do more research on the subject.\n\nWe'll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include\na mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab Runner and CI\/CD),\nNextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level),\nTraefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP\/S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).\n\nWe'll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS' internal network,\nand I'll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.\n\nTo wrap it all up, we'll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups\nwith the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream.\nWe'll write the application, do a 'git push' to GitLab which will trigger a CI\/CD pipeline\nthat will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then,\nwith the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.\n\n\nIf you apply the coupon, I'd appreciate if you leave your feedback on Udemy\nafter you're done and spread the word about the course. It would mean a lot.\n\n\nI hope that you find it useful.\n\n\nHappy learning,\nPredrag",

        "videoDescription":"In this talk, Peter explores the evolution of #DevOps and introduces the concept of full-stack #platformengineering. While DevOps promised to bridge the gap between development and operations, it often resulted in Ops teams scripting infrastructure without applying key software engineering principles. Platform engineering takes this further by treating infrastructure as a product, raising the abstraction level, and enabling developers with scalable, reusable solutions. Peter will explain how they made this shift at Carlsberg and why the future of infrastructure lies in full-stack platform engineers who can think like developers and build for the future.\n\n----\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nPeter Birkholm Buch is a senior technology leader with over 35 years of experience in software engineering, architecture, and cloud computing. As the Head of Software Engineering at Carlsberg, Peter leads a global team of 75 engineers across Portugal, Malaysia, and the Philippines. His expertise lies in driving innovation through cloud-based solutions, platform engineering, and the alignment of DevOps practices. Peter is passionate about improving #DeveloperExperience and ensuring compliance and governance across large-scale engineering teams. He has a unique ability to blend strategy with hands-on technical leadership, making him a sought-after speaker and thought leader in the industry.\n\n----\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Learn more:\nhttps:\/\/www.thedevopsconference.com\/stockholm?utm_campaign=The%20DevOps%20Conference%20Scandinavia%202024&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=youtube_link_stockholm_2024\n\nIf you want to learn more about platform engineering, check out our page here:\nhttps:\/\/www.eficode.com\/platform-engineering?utm_campaign=DevOps&utm_content=185343467&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lis-mAqfpCJwjQ\n\n----\n00:00 Intro  \n00:14 Introduction to the speaker and Carlsberg  \n02:30 The story of Carlsberg  \n05:17 Elevating DevEx and GitHub  \n09:03 Security  \n11:44 A new era in infrastructure management  \n16:26 Audience questions  \n19:25 The rise of full-stack platform engineering  \n21:28 Final words  \n21:47 Outro",

        "videoDescription":"DevOps best practices encompass various principles and techniques aimed at improving collaboration, communication, automation, and efficiency between development and operations teams. Here are some key DevOps best practices:\n\n1. **Culture and Collaboration**: Foster a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility between development, operations, and other relevant teams. Encourage open communication, mutual respect, and empathy to break down silos and promote teamwork.\n\n2. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, such as build and deployment processes, infrastructure provisioning, testing, and monitoring. Use tools like Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes to streamline workflows and reduce manual intervention.\n\n3. **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Implement CI\/CD pipelines to automate the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes. Ensure that code changes are regularly merged into the main branch, tested thoroughly, and deployed to production in a fast and reliable manner.\n\n4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage infrastructure configuration and provisioning using code-based templates or scripts. This enables infrastructure to be version-controlled, tested, and deployed consistently across different environments, leading to greater reliability and reproducibility.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement robust monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance, availability, and health of applications and infrastructure. Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Splunk to gain insights into system behavior and detect issues proactively.\n\n6. **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback loops to gather insights from stakeholders, users, and monitoring systems. Use feedback to identify areas for improvement, prioritize tasks, and make informed decisions about future development and operations efforts.\n\n7. **Security and Compliance**: Integrate security and compliance practices into the DevOps workflow from the outset. Implement security controls, perform regular vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards. Use tools like SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Docker Bench for Security to enhance security posture.\n\n8. **Scalability and Resilience**: Design systems with scalability and resilience in mind to handle fluctuations in demand and withstand failures gracefully. Implement auto-scaling, load balancing, and fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure high availability and performance under varying conditions.\n\n9. **Knowledge Sharing and Documentation**: Encourage knowledge sharing and documentation to capture best practices, lessons learned, and system architecture decisions. Maintain up-to-date documentation, runbooks, and playbooks to facilitate onboarding, troubleshooting, and knowledge transfer within the team.\n\n10. **Performance Optimization**: Continuously optimize performance by identifying bottlenecks, analyzing system metrics, and implementing performance enhancements. Use techniques such as caching, query optimization, and resource utilization monitoring to improve system efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nBy embracing these DevOps best practices, organizations can accelerate software delivery, improve quality, and enhance collaboration across the development and operations lifecycle.\n\n#bigdata #datascience #careergrowth #dataengineering \n#artificialintelligence #machinelearning #devops #microsoft #azure #aws",

Of course, the topic of open source licenses is fascinating to the All Things Open community and we wanted to learn more. During this interview, we talked with Eli about the importance of open source licensing, in particular, how they are automating license enforcement. Then we discussed some trends in DevOps from the perspective of a former DevOps engineer and manager.\n\nRegistration for All Things Open 2024 is now open.

Firstly, the technical layer of SAP is architected in such a way that there are complexities around how you deliver change. The other things that can be important are compliance and the need to really be able to show evidence of how change has progressed, make sure they have been thoroughly tested. The way that SAP works in terms of code changes and tracking changes in the system is quite different from normal developments happening in other coding areas.\n\nThe complexity is quite intense in terms of delivering a specific piece of code across a whole landscape where there might be up to fifty systems involved. Risk reduction is very important. It needs to be navigated well, especially where there's quite a high volume of change. It's forcing a lot of people to have to rethink how custom code is being built.\n\nThey need to get it S\/4 ready for their transformation. And they also need to be able to handle what's commonly called retrofit, which is the synchronization of business as usual changes while they're running the S\/4 project. It's about being able to activate change management quickly and having the data to be able to do that testing effectively to then move your transports quickly and effectively through your SAP landscape. It's brilliant to be working with Rev-Trac.\n\nBoth companies have been in the SAP ecosystem for almost thirty years, and they are also adding fundamental pillars to the DevOps space. We talk about four main things that we offer organizations. It's compliance, safety, automation, and acceleration. Life without Rev-Trac could be a little bit risky, slow, and requiring a lot of manual effort.\n\nLife with Rev-Trac, ultimately, the outcome is you increase both your volume, your quality, and your velocity of change. That's the new norm is getting changes through as quick as possible because things just change at a very quick speed. What Rev-Trac has gotten right here is to give you that opportunity to actually do more of an agile approach in your landscape. Where we're seeing more synergies with EPI-USE Labs these days is also the need to have high quality data in development.\n\nUsing Data Sync Manager, you can move data to Development so a developer could then test their development on actual production-like data, not involving the Basis team, and then move that Development once it's been tested with real data up to the top of the landscape.\"",
